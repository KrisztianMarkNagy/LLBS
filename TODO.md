# To-Do:

##### Short Description:
In a task which is represented as `"- [-][0]: ..."`,
the number inside of the first square describes the precedence level,
or the priority level (the higher the number the higher the priority too),
while the second square describes the state of the task, which can be:
- `-` None/Pending state
- `x` Failed       state
- `o` Success      state

The value (or the content) of a task can be `"..."` representing that it's waiting to be defined.

###   BACKLOG:
